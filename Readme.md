# Theo

Theo is a great hacker showing the other script kiddies how things should be done.

![Theo](./static/theo-profile.png)

He knows [Karl](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/karl) from work.

Theo's purpose is to fight script kiddies that try to be leet hackers. He can listen to them trying to exploit his honeypots and make them lose their funds, for his own gain.

## Install

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cleanunicorn/theo
$ cd theo
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It's recommended to use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) if you're familiar with it.

Requirements: 

- Python 3.5 or higher
- An Ethereum node with RPC available
- Accounts unlocked to be able to send transactions

## Demo

[Scrooge McEtherface](https://github.com/b-mueller/scrooge-mcetherface) tries to exploit a contract but Theo is able to successfully frontrun him.

## Usage

### Help screen

It's a good idea to check the help screen first.

```console
$ python ./theo.py --help
usage: theo.py [-h] [--rpc-http RPC_HTTP] [--rpc-ws RPC_WS]
               [--rpc-ipc RPC_IPC] [--account ACCOUNT] [--contract ADDRESS]
               [--txs {mythril,file}] [--txs-file FILE]
               {tx-pool}

Monitor contracts for balance changes or tx pool.

positional arguments:
  {tx-pool}             Choose between: balance (not implemented: monitor
                        contract balance changes), tx-pool (if any
                        transactions want to call methods).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --contract ADDRESS    Contract to monitor

Monitor transaction pool:
  --rpc-http RPC_HTTP   Connect to this HTTP RPC
  --rpc-ws RPC_WS       Connect to this WebSockets RPC
  --rpc-ipc RPC_IPC     Connect to this IPC RPC
  --account ACCOUNT     Use this account to send transactions from

Transactions to wait for:
  --txs {mythril,file}  Choose between: mythril (find transactions
                        automatically with mythril), file (use the
                        transactions specified in a JSON file).
  --txs-file FILE       The file which contains the transactions to frontrun
```

### Symbolic execution

A list of expoits is automatically identified using [mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril).

Start a session by running:

```console
$ python ./theo.py tx-pool --account=<your unlocked account> --contract=<honeypot>
```

It will analyze the contract and will find a list of available exploits.

```console
$ python theo.py tx-pool --account=0xffcf8fdee72ac11b5c542428b35eef5769c409f0 --contract=0xd833215cbcc3f914bd1c9ece3ee7bf8b14f841bb

>>>
```

You can see the available exploits found. In this case one exploit was found. Each exploit is an [Exploit](https://github.com/cleanunicorn/theo/blob/263dc9f0cd34c4a0904529128c93f30b29eae415/theo/scanner/__init__.py#L9) object, having a list of transactions to exploit a bug.

```console
>>> exploits[0]
Exploit: (txs=[Transaction: {'input': '0xcf7a8965', 'value': '0xde0b6b3a7640000'}])
```

You can start the frontrunning monitor to listen for other hackers (script kiddies really) trying to exploit his honeypots.

Use `.frontrun()` to start listening for the exploit and when found send a transaction with a higher gas price.

```console
>>> exploits[0].frontrun()
Waiting for a victim to reach into the honey jar.
Listening for Transaction: {'input': '0xcf7a8965', 'value': '0xde0b6b3a7640000'}.

```

This works very well for some specially crafted [contracts](./contracts/) or some other vulnerable contracts, as long as you make sure frontrunning is in your favor.

### Load transactions from file

Instead of identifying the exploits with mythril, you can specify the list of exploits yourself.

Create a file that looks like this [input-tx.json](./test/input-tx.json):

```json
[
    [
        {
            "input": "0x4e71e0c8",
            "value": "0xde0b6b3a7640000"
        },
        {
            "input": "0x2e64cec1",
            "value": "0x0"
        }
    ],
    [
        {
            "input": "0x4e71e0c8",
            "value": "0xde0b6b3a7640000"
        }
    ]
]
```

This one defines 2 exploits, the first one has 2 transactions and the second one only 1 transaction. After the exploits are loaded, frontrunning is the same.

```console
$ python ./theo.py --txs=file --contract=0xe78a0f7e598cc8b0bb87894b0f60dd2a88d6a8ab --account=0xffcf8fdee72ac11b5c542428b35eef5769c409f0 --txs-file=./test/input-tx.json tx-pool     130 â†µ
Found exploits(s) [Exploit: (txs=[Transaction: {'input': '0x4e71e0c8', 'value': '0xde0b6b3a7640000'}, Transaction: {'input': '0x2e64cec1', 'value': '0x0'}]), Exploit: (txs=[Transaction: {'input': '0x4e71e0c8', 'value': '0xde0b6b3a7640000'}])]
